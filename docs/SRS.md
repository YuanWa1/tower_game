# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the requirements and design for a C++ strategy game using the Qt framework. The game involves players controlling towers, generating units, and strategically capturing enemy or neutral towers through real-time unit deployment. This document outlines the gameâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements to guide the development team and ensure clarity on the project scope.

## 1.2 Document Conventions  
- **Bold** is used to highlight key concepts and terms.
- *Italic* is used for emphasis.
- Monospace (`code like this`) is used for code snippets or file paths.

## 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions  
This document is intended for:
- **Developers**: To implement the game as per the functional and technical specifications.
- **Testers**: To validate that the game behaves as expected and meets performance standards.

It is recommended to read this document in sequence for a complete understanding, especially for developers who need to follow the design from concept to implementation.

## 1.4 Product Scope  
This game is a real-time strategy game where players manage towers that generate units to capture other towers on the map. The gameplay includes real-time decision-making and unit management, with heroes providing buffs to the towers. Multithreading is used to handle unit generation and combat logic efficiently, ensuring smooth gameplay and real-time updates. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for a clean separation of game logic, user interface, and player input. The game is developed for both Windows and Linux platforms, with potential future extensions for advanced features such as unit hierarchies, AI opponents, and multiplayer capabilities.

## 1.6 Definitions  
- **Units**: Entities generated by towers, used to attack and capture other towers.
- **Towers**: Structures that generate units at a regular interval and can be captured or defended by players.
- **Heroes**: Special units stationed inside towers to provide buffs (such as increased unit production).
- **War Scene**: A logical background environment where unit combat is processed while visual animations show units moving along paths.
- **Reinforcements**: Additional units sent during combat to strengthen the player's side.
- **Space Holder for future**
